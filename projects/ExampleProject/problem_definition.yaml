    # Choose: algebraic, optimization
    # component_fitting: algebraic
    component_fitting: optimization
    # Method for fitting the components of the elastic tensor.
    # In algebraic, fixed equations define the components (i.e. C_11 = stress_xx / strain_xx)
    # In optimization, a general data fitting approach with an optimizer is used. This allows
    # for more data points to be used for better averaging.

    # Only effected in "optimization" mode, for algebraic this option is always "minimum"
    # Choose: minimum, all_directions, combined_directions
    number_of_load_cases: minimum
    # More then the minimum number of simulations can be used for better averaging
    # all_directions uses a signle strain step in all 6 directions (xx, yy, zz, xy, xz, yz)
    # combined_directions combines all sets of 2 directions (xx+yy, xx+zz, ...). 21 in total.
    # For some material types (orthotropic, monoclinic, anisotropic), minimum and all_directions are the same
    # When using minimum: if there is symmetry over multiple axis, the following priority is used to represent the other axis:
    # xx, yy, zz, xy, xz, yz
    # So for isentropic materials for example, the strain in xx direction will be used to represent the symmetry in yy, zz directions.

    # NOTE: More results then the minimum defined here can accumilate in the
    #       stored results (results/results_database.yaml). To make sure only
